# Static AI Instructions

Instructions loaded once, then executed. This covers everything from simple system prompts to complex agent definitions.

## What This Covers

All of these share the same underlying structure and are written as **Markdown files (.md) with XML tags for structure** (not actual XML files):

| Artifact | What It Is | Examples |
|----------|------------|----------|
| **System Prompt** | Traditional system message in API calls | Classification prompt, chat persona |
| **Command/Skill** | Expandable instruction triggered by user | `/commit`, `/review-pr`, skill files |
| **Agent Definition** | Full agent with tools and autonomous workflow | Research agent, code reviewer |
| **Workflow File** | Multi-phase autonomous execution | Build pipeline, data processing |
| **Directive** | Instruction handed to a running system | Claude Code task, background agent |

They're all "system prompts" in spirit—static instructions that shape AI behavior before dynamic context arrives.

**Key principle**: Static instructions define WHAT and HOW. Dynamic context (user prompt) provides the specific inputs and runtime state.

## Key Distinction

The fundamental split in prompt design: **who controls execution?**

| Aspect | Single-Completion | Multiturn |
|--------|-------------------|-----------|
| **Control** | Your code controls the LLM | Autonomous system controls itself |
| **Execution** | You call API, process response, decide next | System runs multiple turns on its own |
| **Loop Owner** | Your application | The agent/system |
| **Examples** | Classification, extraction, code-orchestrated agents | Claude Code skills, background agents, pipelines |

**Single-Completion**: Your code makes the LLM call. Your code processes the response. You decide what happens next. Even if you're doing multi-step agentic work, if YOUR code orchestrates the calls, it's single-completion.

**Multiturn**: You submit instructions to an autonomous system. The system decides what LLM calls to make, what tools to use, and when it's done. You direct; the system executes.

**The distinction is about WHO controls the execution loop, not whether tools are involved.**

Tool use is fine in single-completion—you can use structured outputs, function calling, etc. The question is: does your code handle the tool execution, or does an autonomous system?

### Choosing Your Pattern

```
Is YOUR code calling the LLM API and processing responses?
├─ YES → Single-Completion (20-workflow-design/20-single-completion.md)
│         Your code orchestrates, LLM completes tasks
│
└─ NO → Multiturn (you hand off to an autonomous system)
         │
         Does the user provide input each cycle?
         ├─ YES → Iterative Loop (20-workflow-design/30-multi-turn/10-iterative-loop.md)
         │         Interviews, spec refinement, requirements
         │
         └─ NO → Autonomous (20-workflow-design/30-multi-turn/00-base.md)
                  Skills, background agents, pipelines
```
