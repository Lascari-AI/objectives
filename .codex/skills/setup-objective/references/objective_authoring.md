# Objective Authoring

Use this reference when writing `goal.md`, `context/*.md`, or the initial
working plan for a serious objective. The objective bundle is not a notes
folder. It is the durable operating context that future agents will execute.

## Authoring Standard

Write objective files as context-engineered instructions, not vague project
notes. Each section must answer what the agent should do, what input it should
use, what output it should produce, and how it knows the step is complete.

Borrow these principles from prompt engineering:

- use semantic pseudo-XML tags for structure;
- separate instructions, data, constraints, state, and examples;
- use imperative wording for actions and gates;
- make every section earn its token cost;
- include concrete output schemas when a file, CSV, report, or command result
  is expected;
- include failure handling so the agent does not silently accept weak evidence;
- include progress, logging, checkpoint, resume, and runtime-control contracts
  for long-running objective-local scripts;
- use contrastive examples when the likely failure mode is generic work.

Do not copy the prompt skill's run model. Objective files are not prompt-run
artifacts. Use the prompt skill's discipline: clear structure, explicit inputs,
gates, and evaluation.

## Required Depth

For nontrivial objectives, every context file should be specific enough that a
fresh agent can start useful work without asking what "analyze", "validate",
"sweep", "audit", or "finish" means.

Avoid lazy placeholders:

- "Run tests"
- "Analyze results"
- "Try thresholds"
- "Write report"
- "Validate candidate"
- "Update state"

Replace them with executable guidance:

- exact commands or command families;
- datasets, shards, configs, caches, or artifacts to read;
- output files and required columns;
- decision gates and rejection criteria;
- candidate families and ablation rows;
- known risks and what to do when they appear;
- handoff updates and final report requirements.

## File Responsibilities

Keep `goal.md` short enough for `/goal`, but make it dense. Put depth in
`context/*.md`.

- `goal.md`: outcome, context-refresh path, working strategy, success metrics,
  non-goals, completion criteria.
- `current_state.md`: compact live state, durable decisions, next actions,
  risks, important paths.
- `context/00_problem.md`: why this objective exists, current baseline,
  failure modes, expected value, prior evidence.
- `context/01_constraints.md`: hard validity rules, forbidden shortcuts,
  production boundaries, data boundaries, promotion gates.
- `context/02_implementation_scope.md`: owned files, read-only references,
  allowed edits, risky adjacent surfaces, generated artifacts.
- `context/03_working_plan.md`: phase-gated execution plan with inputs,
  process, outputs, gates, artifacts, long-running runner contracts, and
  failure handling.
- `context/04_validation_and_handoff.md`: validation ladder, acceptance gates,
  report requirements, state updates, active-run handoff rules,
  promotion/handoff rules.

## Pseudo-XML Formatting

Use semantic tags and 4-space indentation inside tags. Markdown bullets are
allowed inside tags.

```xml
<working_plan>
    <overview>
        1. baseline_reproduction - Reproduce the current baseline and record
           metrics before changing behavior.
        2. matrix_design - Generate candidate rows with explicit families,
           features, thresholds, and risk postures.
    </overview>
</working_plan>
```

Prefer descriptive tags over generic tags. Use `<baseline_reproduction>`, not
`<step_1>`. Use `<promotion_gate>`, not `<notes>`.

## Working Plan Shape

`context/03_working_plan.md` should use this shape for substantial objectives:

```xml
<working_plan>
    <overview>
        1. [phase_name] - [one-line intent]
        2. [phase_name] - [one-line intent]
        3. [phase_name] - [one-line intent]
    </overview>

    <operating_principles>
        - [Non-negotiable principle that applies to all phases.]
        - [Priority rule for resolving speed, safety, score, or scope tradeoffs.]
    </operating_principles>

    <phase id="1" name="[phase_name]">
        <objective>
            - [Specific outcome for this phase.]
        </objective>
        <inputs>
            - [Files, artifacts, commands, datasets, or prior outputs.]
        </inputs>
        <process>
            - [Imperative action.]
            - [Imperative action.]
            - If [condition], [specific branch]. Otherwise, [specific branch].
        </process>
        <outputs>
            - `[artifact/path.ext]`: [required contents or columns].
        </outputs>
        <gate>
            - [Concrete condition required before moving to the next phase.]
        </gate>
        <failure_handling>
            - If [failure mode], [diagnose, narrow scope, or stop condition].
        </failure_handling>
    </phase>
</working_plan>
```

Every phase should be self-contained. The output of one phase should become an
input to a later phase. If a phase produces no artifact, no decision, and no
state update, remove it or merge it into another phase.

## Working Plan Required Blocks

For complex optimization or implementation objectives, include these blocks
when relevant:

- `<baseline_reproduction>`: exact baseline artifacts, commands, metrics, and
  mismatch handling.
- `<candidate_matrix_design>`: candidate families, feature columns, thresholds,
  ablations, unsafe anchors, near-misses, and config schema.
- `<proxy_sweep>`: cheap screening metrics, per-shard rows, aggregation logic,
  vectorization/chunking, and selection rules.
- `<frontier_selection>`: Pareto criteria, anchors, near-misses, family
  coverage, and rejection reasons.
- `<full_validation>`: validation shards, commands, result schema, by-ladder
  summaries, and promotion gates.
- `<diagnostics>`: residual examples, false-merge audits, cohort summaries,
  visual sheets, or stage-attribution ledgers.
- `<runtime_observability>`: log paths, status/progress command, heartbeat
  cadence, progress schema, elapsed-time and ETA reporting.
- `<checkpoint_resume>`: checkpoint cadence, atomic write behavior, resume
  command, completed-work detection, incompatible-change handling.
- `<runtime_controls>`: safe live-adjustable variables, control-file or signal
  mechanism, validation rules, immutable variables, and audit logging.
- `<productionization>`: files to edit, config flags, mask equivalence checks,
  tests, and rollback boundaries.
- `<reporting>`: report sections, final tables, state updates, and next-route
  handoff.

## Long-Running Runner Contract

When an objective creates or relies on a script that may run longer than a few
minutes, consult `references/long_running_handoff_and_scripts.md` before
finalizing `context/03_working_plan.md` or
`context/04_validation_and_handoff.md`.

Capture the objective-specific subset of that contract in the context files:

- observability: durable log file, progress/status artifact or command,
  heartbeat timestamp, start time, elapsed time, completed/total units when
  known, current phase, recent throughput, and ETA when defensible;
- restartability: checkpoints written after bounded units of work, atomic
  artifact writes, idempotent reruns, explicit resume/force-rebuild behavior,
  and metadata that detects incompatible code/config/input changes;
- live controls where safe: dynamic concurrency, chunk size, rate limit,
  pause/resume, stop-after-current-unit, or other variables that do not change
  result meaning; log every accepted or rejected change;
- correctness boundaries: variables that affect semantic validity must be
  immutable for the run or start a clearly named new run segment with lineage;
- handoff: `current_state.md` should name active command, PID/session if
  available, start time, status path, log path, checkpoint path, control/config
  path, and safest next action.

          status path, log path, checkpoint path, control/config path, and safe
          next action.
    </handoff_update>
</validation_and_handoff>
```

## Anti-Lazy Checks

Before accepting an objective bundle, check it against these questions:

- Could a fresh agent execute the first phase without asking what to read?
- Does every phase have concrete inputs, outputs, and a gate?
- Are expected artifacts named, including required columns or fields?
- For long-running scripts, can a future agent inspect progress, view logs,
  estimate health, tune safe variables, and resume after interruption?
- Are failure modes and invalid shortcuts explicit?
- Does the plan include decision logic, not only activity descriptions?
- Are validation gates objective enough to reject a tempting weak result?
- Does the bundle state what should happen if the best candidate is unsafe?
- Is the context curated, or did it accumulate unrelated history?

If the answer to any question is no, revise the context before starting work.

## Contrastive Example

Bad working-plan entry:

```xml
<working_plan>
    - Sweep thresholds and analyze results.
    - Validate the best one.
</working_plan>
```

Good working-plan entry:

```xml
<phase id="2" name="candidate_matrix_design">
    <objective>
        - Generate a deployable config matrix that tests endpoint rescue,
          low-agreement rescue, and repeated-pattern brake interactions.
    </objective>
    <inputs>
        - `artifacts/baseline_summary.json`
        - `artifacts/residual_ledger.csv`
        - Prior visual taxonomy in `artifacts/pattern_notes.md`
    </inputs>
    <process>
        - Create one baseline row, one unsafe high-recall anchor per family,
          conservative and high-recall threshold bands, one-factor ablations,
          and near-miss rows around the expected safety boundary.
        - Record every threshold, feature source, risk class, and selection
          reason in the matrix.
        - If a candidate needs truth labels or hand labels as inputs, mark it
          `diagnostic_only` and exclude it from production selection.
    </process>
    <outputs>
        - `artifacts/config_matrix.csv`: includes `config_id`, `family`,
          `search_pass`, `posture`, `feature_sources`, `risk_class`,
          `ablation_of`, `near_miss_reason`, thresholds, and gates.
    </outputs>
    <gate>
        - Matrix contains baseline, unsafe anchors, ablations, near-misses,
          and at least one production-shaped row for every active family.
    </gate>
    <failure_handling>
        - If required feature columns are missing, write
          `artifacts/missing_feature_audit.csv` and route the objective to
          feature plumbing before running proxy sweeps.
    </failure_handling>
</phase>
```

## Authoring Rubric

Evaluate objective context before using it:

- Structural precision: semantic pseudo-XML, clear hierarchy, no wall of text.
- Execution value: phases include inputs, process, outputs, gates, and failure
  handling.
- Context quality: only relevant prior evidence is included, with paths.
- Decision quality: gates, risk budgets, rejection criteria, and promotion
  routes are concrete.
- Handoff value: artifacts and `current_state.md` updates let another agent
  reproduce the decision, inspect active runs, and resume safely when work is
  interrupted.

Do not start a serious objective from context that fails any of these areas.
